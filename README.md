# go-intro
This repo is meant to introduce some basic Golang concepts: functions, 
composite literals, method receivers, embedding, interfaces, multiple return types, and errors.  
This was created to assist a screen cast that introduces the concepts.

I did not original know how I wanted to gradually introduce new concepts so it is a little out of order.  
Here is what is in each branch and the progression order:  
1. Method-receiver-and-composite-literal branch  
2. Master branch (covers embedding, interfaces, promotion, polymorphic behavior)  
3. Interface-as-a-parameter branch (more interfaces)  
4. Errors-and-multiple-returns branch
