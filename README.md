# go-intro
This repo is meant to introduce some basic Golang concepts: functions,
composite literals, method receivers, embedding, interfaces, multiple return types, and errors.  
This was created to assist a screen cast that introduces the concepts.

It is intended to start off in the folder part1 and work the way to the folder part4.
